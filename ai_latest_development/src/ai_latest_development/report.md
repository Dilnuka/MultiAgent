# üìä Executive Summary

- **What this is about:** Risk assessment for implementing AI in a Hotel Management System within the EU, focusing on model training using hotel data.
- **Scope:** Data use = Hotel Management Data; scenario = Model training; year = 2025.
- **Top 3 Risks (plain language):**
  1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Algorithmic Bias:** The AI could make unfair decisions based on biased data, potentially leading to discrimination in guest experiences or pricing.
  2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Privacy Violations:** Sensitive guest data might be exposed through breaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of AI models, resulting in regulatory penalties and reputational damage.
  3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** The hotel might fail to meet GDPR and the upcoming EU AI Act requirements, incurring substantial fines and operational restrictions.
- **Top 3 Recommended Actions:**
  1. ‚úÖ **Implement a Data Governance Framework:** Establish clear policies and procedures for data handling, AI model development, and usage (business benefit: improved data quality and reduced risk).
  2. ‚úÖ **Strengthen Access Controls:** Implement robust access controls, including MFA and RBAC, to protect sensitive guest data (security benefit: reduced risk of unauthorized access and data breaches).
  3. ‚úÖ **Conduct Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs):** Proactively assess and mitigate privacy risks associated with AI systems (compliance benefit: demonstrating compliance with GDPR and preparing for the EU AI Act).

  ‚úÖ Controls: Implement strong authentication mechanisms (MFA, password policies), and regularly audit user accounts and access rights.
- **Tampering:** Unauthorized modification of data or model parameters.
  ‚úÖ Controls: Employ data integrity checks, version control for models, and restrict access to model training and deployment environments. Use digital signatures.
- **Repudiation:** Denial that an action was performed.
  ‚úÖ Controls: Implement comprehensive logging and auditing of all system activities, including model training, deployment, and usage.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive guest data or model parameters.
  üîí Controls: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, implement strong access controls (RBAC, MFA), and regularly audit data access.
- **Denial of Service:** Attacks that make the system unavailable to legitimate users.
  ‚úÖ Controls: Implement rate limiting, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and ensure sufficient system resources.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Gaining higher-level access than authorized.
  ‚úÖ Controls: Enforce the principle of least privilege, and regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.

## üìñ Assumptions and Limits

-   **Assumption:** This analysis assumes that the hotel has a well-defined data inventory and that data quality is assessed.
-   **Limitation:** This analysis does not provide legal advice; the hotel must consult with legal counsel for compliance with GDPR and the EU AI Act. This analysis is based on the current understanding of the proposed AI Act; requirements could change.

# Healthcare Appointment Booking Assistant Risk Report - USA

**Executive Summary**

This report assesses the risks associated with implementing an AI-powered appointment booking assistant in a healthcare setting within the USA, focusing on data privacy, security, and system availability. The analysis considers potential data breaches (HIPAA violations), unintended patient detail disclosures, and denial-of-service attacks. Key findings highlight vulnerabilities in API security, model inference, and system resilience. The primary risks stem from the potential for unauthorized access to Protected Health Information (PHI) and service disruptions. The recommendations prioritize robust API security, data encryption, access controls, model monitoring, and incident response planning. Implementing these recommendations will help mitigate risks, ensure HIPAA compliance, and maintain patient trust while enabling the benefits of an AI-powered appointment booking system.

**Key Findings**

*   **Data Breach Vulnerability:** API security vulnerabilities and improper data storage represent the highest risk for PHI exposure, leading to potential HIPAA violations.
*   **Model Inference Risks:** Adversarial attacks and prompt injection are potential threats.
*   **System Downtime:** Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks could disrupt appointment booking and negatively impact patient care.
*   **Compliance Gaps:** Failure to comply with HIPAA regulations can result in significant penalties.
*   **Lack of explainability:** Could lead to lack of trust with patients.

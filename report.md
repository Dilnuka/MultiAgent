# Risk Report: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot - EU (2025)

## Executive Summary

This report assesses the risks associated with the implementation of an AI-powered customer support chatbot within a bank operating in the European Union. The primary concerns are prompt injection leading to data exfiltration, membership inference attacks on chat logs, and ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act and GDPR. This report identifies key risks, provides a risk assessment, and offers prioritized recommendations to mitigate these risks. The overarching goal is to ensure the chatbot’s secure, ethical, and compliant deployment, fostering customer trust and minimizing potential financial and reputational damage. Proactive measures are essential given the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly with the advent of the EU AI Act.

## Key Findings

*   **Prompt Injection:** The chatbot is vulnerable to malicious prompts that could expose sensitive customer data (account information, transaction history).
*   **Membership Inference:** Attackers could leverage chatbot interaction logs to determine if specific customer data was used in the training of the model, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **EU AI Act Compliance:** The chatbot’s operation must adhere to strict requirements regarding risk management, data governance, transparency, and human oversight.
*   **GDPR Compliance:** The processing of customer data within the chatbot must comply with GDPR principles, including data minimization, security, and data subject rights.
*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with regulations (GDPR, EU AI Act) poses significant legal and financial risks.
*   **Bias and Discrimination:** The chatbot could exhibit biases, leading to unfair outcomes for certain customer groups.
